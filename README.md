## AIES Tutorial For Traditional ML Explainability 

This repository is the code associated with the AMS AIES manuscript titled: "An Introductory Machine Learning Explainability Tutorial for Environmental Sciences" written by Flora, M, Potvin, C, McGovern, A, and Handler, S. Find the paper here and provide any comments via email to the corresponding author. If you have any issues with the code (bugs or other questions) please leave an issue associated with this repo.

This paper and repo covers a general approach to explaining and understanding traditional supervised machine learning methods (e.g., the sklearn models). Topics in the paper include interpretability versus explainability, local versus global explainability, as well feature importance versus feature relevance. We demonstrate explainability using Shapley-based methods as they have been found to unifying many pre-existing explainability methods ([Lundberg et al. 2016](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/8a20a8621978632d76c43dfd28b67767-Abstract.html), Covert et al. 2020[a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00668),[b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14878)).


## Getting Started 

This paper strives to provide a comprehensive understanding of model explainability, even for those who may be new to the concept. While we assume familiarity with ML methods and terminology, we recommend [Chase et al. repo](https://github.com/ai2es/WAF_ML_Tutorial_Part1) for novice readers. These resources offer a great introduction to ML for operational meteorology and provide open-source code to help apply the methods. The process for setting up a python environment should also include all the neccesary packages (including scikit-explain) to begin using the tutorial notebooks in this repo.
